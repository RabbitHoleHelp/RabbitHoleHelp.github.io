📏-rules

**Welcome to Rabbithole.help**
**part 2: The memoryhole**

Rules:
- listen to the admins and moderators
- respect each other
- no calls for violence
- free chat in #💬-main-chat and #🗨-alt-chat 
- admins can and will remove whoever needed

The channels under the RESEARCH SHARING category:
- we collect links relevant to each channel
- post in the proper channels.
- keep the chatting in these channels to a minimum
- these channels are archived and visible without discord at http://rabbithole.help/

Lurking is fine. Try to keep to the ethos of this server.

Adding the /github to the end of your webhook URL is absolutely needed. You get a bunch of 400s if you leave it out.
